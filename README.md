# Gitlab CI Templates

Templates are mostly from the existing some projects or issues.

## Difficulty on Gitlab CI

Rewriting GitLab CI code can be challenging due to the following pain points:

- Understanding existing pipelines
- Testing and validation
- Handling complex workflows
- Managing secrets and environment variables
- Collaboration and communication

To mitigate these challenges, break down the rewriting process, test thoroughly, document changes, and communicate effectively with team members.That's why the templates are provided.

## Documentation

Detail about the usage of templates can refer to the [documentation](https://msclock.gitlab.io/gitlab-ci-templates/).
